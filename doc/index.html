<h2><a id="Why">What ADA Does</a></h2>
<p>
The Athlete Data Analysis application ("ADA") is designed to help fencers understand what happens during their bouts. By 
using it to gather counts of actions which result in scored touches, you can understand what things you are doing work,
and what things others do work against you.  This can help guide you in your training when you're not competing.
</p>
<h2><a id="Install">Installing ADA</a></h2>
<p>
Currently, ADA is available from <a href="http://tomshiro.org/ADA">the
ADA beta test site</a>.  ADA is not currently on the Google Play
Store, so you'll need to enable the <b>Unknown Sources</b> checkbox in
your Android device's <b>Applications</b> or <b>Security</b> settings.
After you've done this, you can put the beta URL into your phone's
browser. Your browser will download the ADA package and put a message
in your Android Notifications about it (the same place where your
calendar puts reminders about things on your schedule).  Pull down the
Notification screen and touch the ADA download notification to load
the software.  If you get a message asking which software should
handle the ADA.apk file, you want the <b>Android Package
Installer</b>.
</p>
<h2><a id="Input">Gathering Data</a></h2>
<p>
When you start ADA by touching the ADA icon in your Applications screen, you will see the <b>root menu</b>, which
consists of two buttons, as:<br/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Start.jpeg" alt="Opening Screen" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
Touch the <b>Input</b> button to bring up the input screen:<br/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Input.jpeg" alt="Input Screen" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<h3>At the start of the bout</h3>
<p>
Enter the names of the two fencers in the bout in the first pair of
boxes.  You can type a name here if the fencer is new to the program,
or touch the downarrow on the right side of the box to scroll through
a list of names already in ADA's database.
</p>
<p>
When the director or a fencer says ''ready, Fence'', start recording bout information by bringing up the <b>context menu</b> and touching the <b>Start Bout</b> button: <br/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Startbout.jpeg" alt="Start Bout" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
The <b>Context Menu</b> is the menu you can bring up in Android with
the <b>menu</b> icon or button, typically indicated with a series of
horizontal lines.  This records the time that the bout started in
ADA's database, so that later you can ask ADA for things like ''How
soon did the first touch occur when my fencer got it?''.
</p>
<h3>When a touch occurs</h3>
<p>
When one or both fencers score a touch, the action will stop.  When
that happens, record what happened by touching the left or right (or
both) <b>Scored</b> checkboxes on the <b>Input</b> screen, then using
the spinners below the scoring checkboxes to choose what action
precipitated the touch on each side:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Chooseaction.jpeg" alt="Choose Action" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
You can then press the <b>Commit</b> button at the bottom of the
screen to add this touch to ADA's database. When you do this, ADA will
update the score indicators above the left and right <b>Scored</b>
checkboxes as appropriate, so that you can keep track of where you are
in the bout.  You can also press the <b>Clear</b> button here if you
or the director makes a mistake in the score or other entry. If your
Android screen is longer than it is wide, you may be able to turn your
phone sideways to make this screen a little more legible.
</p>
<h3>At the end of the bout</h3>
<p>
When the bout ends, bring up the <b>Context Menu</b> again and press
either <b>New Bout</b> (to stay on <b>Input</b>)
or <b>Finish</b> (to return to <b>root menu</b>). This will record
the time that the bout finished, so you can later ask ADA questions
like ''How long did winning bouts last for my fencer''?
</p>
<h2><a id="Output">Reporting on what you have found</a></h2>
<p>
ADA features an ad-hoc reporting facility which allows you to create
reports on the data you have gathered without having to re-compile or
edit the software itself.  I'll document how that works in a separate
essay.  So far, I am shipping ADA with only a few configured reports,
since I am still learning what might be most valuable to fencers and
coaches.
</p>

<h3>Using a configured report</h3>
<p>
To run a report on the data you have collected, touch the <b>Report</b> button on ADA's <b>root menu</b>. This will bring up the <b>Report menu</b>, which consists of a spinner containing report names and a <b>Run</b> button.  Choose the report you wish to run and press <b>Run</b>:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Reportchoice.jpeg" alt="Choosing a report" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
This will bring up the <b>Report Configuration</b> screen, where you can pick the parameters for the report 
which you wish to see:<br>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Reportconfig.jpeg" alt="Configuring your report" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
After you have selected your parameters, press the <b>Report</b> button to run your report:<br>
</p>
<p>
<img src="Screenshots/Reportrun.jpeg" alt="Running a report" height="440" width="220">
</p>
<p>
Press <b>Quit</b> to return to the <b>Report Configuration</b> screen, and <b>return</b> to go back to the <b>root menu</b>.

<h2 <a id="Hackery">Clearing the database and other tricks</a></h2>
<h3>ADA database</h3>
<p>
ADA keeps all of her database and report configuration files on your
SD card, in a directory called <b>org.tomshiro.ada</b>. If you wish to
clear the database, you can easily do so by mounting the SD card in
your android device on a PC and removing or renaming
the <b>org.tomshiro.ada/database/ada.db</b> file.  When you next run
ADA, she will re-create this file with its contents as it was when you first ran the software.
</p>
<p>
If you are feeling brave and you have some sql experience, you can
also alter or add to the types of actions or do other operations on
ADA's tables with the <b>sqlite3</b> command-line tool, available in
most Linux repositories and possibly for Windows as well.  I would
deeply like to know what things you'd like to change, so that I can
incorporate your ideas into the next release of ADA.
</p>
<h3>ADA Reports</h3>
<p>
Configuration files for ADA's reports live in
the <b>org.tomshiro.ada/reports</b> directory.  Each report consists
of a subdirectory here. The name of the subdirectory is what appears
in the <b>report menu</b> in ADA.  I have so far not documented the
parameter files yet, but you're welcome to explore around in there.
ADA does not contain much error-handling code for report files, so if
you write a new report you may find that she will abend on simple
errors. When the report format is stable, I will publish a lint(1)
program for report parameter files to simplify writing them.
</p>
<h3>Known Troubles</h3>
<p>
This is <b>beta</b> software, so it probably has bugs and will crash in ways
I am not aware of.  I do know that it will abend if you run it while
your SD card is mounted to your computer, or if your SD card is out of
your phone.  The next iteration of ADA will give a proper error and
refuse to run under these circumstances.  I would like to know of
other ways you can cause it to abend or work in unexpected ways.
