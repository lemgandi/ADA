Ideas for the Next Version

* Fix input hole 

  Extend db to add Action/Response/Both domain for Action_type.  Use
  this to alter the spinner choice lists on the 2nd entered spinner so if
  you choose an Action on one you can only choose Response/Both on the
  other or vice versa.  Thus it becomes impossible to enter a scoring
  action where both fencers retreat, for example.

* Add histograms

  Add a Histogram report display file to Reports/report_name. Display
  "Histogram" button on ReportActivity.  Error politely if
  Reports/Report_name/Histogram.xml is not present. It might be fun to have pie charts as well.

* Add database merge

  Add the ability to pull records from a 2nd database, so that a
  coach(say) could pull data from a minions' phone and add it to his
  own database.

* Add Foil Mode to parameters

  Add the ability to disable double-touches in the input screen, so
  that you could not enter them in foil/saber bouts.

* Add Security Option

  Add ability to keep database on phone memory, so it could be
  private if necessary.

* Add database maintenance

  Add editors for all tables under button on main screen.

* Write a reportLint python script

  This script will check Input.xml, Output.xml, and Query.xml for XML correctitude, and check that the "name" attribs in 
  the <InputField> nodes in "Input" have corresponding <Param ref=""> nodes in "Query".  
  
* Clear database and reports directories on uninstall

* Create XML Schemas ( http://www.w3schools.com/schema/ ) for all Report xml files.
  
  Figure out how namespaces and all the rest of that wild & crazy XML stuff is supposed to work.
  
* Add README file with pointer to more doc to /mnt/sdcard/org.tomshiro.ada .
  

* Color scoring and drop-down buttons red and green to match left and right lights on scoring machines
