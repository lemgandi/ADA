<H1>Welcome to the Athlete Data Analysis Beta Test Site</H1>
<p>
Here you can install the beta version of the ADA tool to your Android phone.  This software is still under
development.  It's possible that it will destroy your phone, make phone calls to your children without your 
knowledge, sell your dog for cash, burn your underwear, or otherwise ruin your life.  It may also not work.  
If it does any of those things, I would like to know, but I won't help you get your life back.
</p>
<p>
Since you are getting this application from my website rather than the Google Play Store, you must explicitly
allow your phone to install it.  To do this, find the <b>Applications</b> menu in your <b>Settings</b>, then check the 
<b>Unknown Sources</b> checkbox there.  This will allow you to install ADA from the link below. Leaving this box set
is a slight security risk, but you can un-check it after you have installed this software.
</p>
<p>
When you press the link below, your browser will download the ADA package and give you a <b>Download complete</b> 
notification.  This will turn up in the same place you see calendar and update notifications.  If you 
activate that notification by pressing it with your finger, it will ask if you wish to install the application. 
Just as if you downloaded the application from the Play Store, it will ask you for permissions; there will be only
one permission here -- the ability to write to your SD card.  Follow the prompts to put the ADA tool on your phone.
